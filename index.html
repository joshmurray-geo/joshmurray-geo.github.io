          <strong>The carbon cycle of planets is fundamentally controlled by mineral reactions.</strong> <br><br>
          Through a combination of field methods, proxies, and quantitative models, I investigate the local and global mechanisms that modulate and stabilise climate. Specifically, I study the formation and breakdown of carbon-bearing minerals across a variety of surface and deep environments. These reactions are the focus of recent carbon sequestration efforts as scientists look for nature-inspired solutions to anthropogenic warming.  I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (part of Columbia University). <br><br>
			     <!-- I work to understand why Earth's climate has changed over long timescales, and why it differs from other planets. Our pre-industrial climate was substantially colder than, say, the Cretaceous, yet the mechanism of that cooling is not well known. The transfer of carbon between the lithosphere and the ocean-atmosphere system is fundamentally driven by mineral reactions. Those reactions are critical to long-term palaeoclimate and may inspire methods of carbon capture. I constrain the forces that govern carbon cycle dynamics using field methods, proxies, and quantitative models.
